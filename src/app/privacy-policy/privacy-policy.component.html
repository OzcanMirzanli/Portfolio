    <h3>
      General Information on the Legal Bases for Data Processing on This Website
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you have given consent to data processing, we process your personal
      data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if
      special categories of data are processed under Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. In the
      case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third
      countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.
      If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information
      on your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is
      additionally based on § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any
      time. If your data is necessary for the performance of a contract or for
      the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data based
      on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this
      is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c
      GDPR. Data processing may also occur based on our legitimate interests
      under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The relevant legal bases for data
      processing will be explained in the following sections of this Privacy
      Policy.
    </p>
    <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>
      In the course of our business activities, we work with various external
      entities. In some cases, it is necessary to transfer personal data to
      these external entities. We only pass on personal data to external
      entities if this is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are
      legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if
      we have a legitimate interest in the transfer under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f
      GDPR, or if another legal basis allows the data transfer. When using
      processors, we only transfer personal data of our customers based on a
      valid contract for processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract
      for joint processing will be concluded.
    </p>
    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
    <p>
      Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit
      consent. You can revoke any consent you have already given at any time.
      The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation
      remains unaffected by the revocation.
    </p>

      SITUATION, TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
      PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RELEVANT LEGAL BASIS FOR THE

      INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING IS NECESSARY FOR THE
      ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART.

      You have the right to receive data that we process automatically based on
      your consent or in the performance of a contract in a commonly used,
      machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to
      another controller, this will only be done to the extent technically
      feasible.

    <p>
      Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
      right to obtain information about your stored personal data, its origin,
